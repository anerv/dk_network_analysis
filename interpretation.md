# Interpretation of results

## Socio variables and share of bikeability clusters

- Negative relationship between share of high bikeability and car ownership

- Positive relationship between share of high income and low bikeability

- Interesting pattern for share of hex cluster 5 (highest bikeability)? Because of strong spatial clustering of this one?

- Some correlation of share of cluster 3 and high income

- Otherwise no clear patterns?

## Socio variables

- Positive correlation between students and very high and very low income
- Negative between students and all middle income groups

- Negative relationship between high income and all other income groups except second highest

- Positive relationships between middle income groups - especailly 200-300 and 300 - 400 and 150-200 and 200-300.

- If many households have cars, many also tend to have 2 cars.

- Negative between cars (households with cars) and students - but not for 2 cars?

- Positive between highest income and car ownership - but negative with just 1 car

- Negative between share of 2 cars and share of low and middle income (up to 500)

- Negative between car ownership and income (up to 500)

- But positive between 1 car and middle income

- Negative between 1 car and high income

- Positive between income 50th percentile and 2 cars and car ownership - but negative for 1 car

## CCI curves

### LTS and low income

- LTS 1 density - fairly close to equality when ordered by low income - but slight indication that areas with very low percentage of low income households have above expected LTS 1 density????

- Same for other network levels, although less inequality? (i.e. less tendency to concentrate low stress among low income areas?)

- When looking at length, the pattern is reversed! Meaning that areas with low shares of low income people have more than expected *length* of network??? Tendency is stronger for higher LTS and whole network - indicating that they get more than "expected" LTS 1, but even more so for other network types?

### LTS and medium income

- Density and medium income: Areas with low share of medium income have above expected/equal lts 1 and lts<2 density, areas with high shares have less. Same for highter LTS and full network, but stronger tendency for LTS 1.

- Length and medium income: Almost perfect equality for lts 1. Slight inequality for higher LTS, and increasing with increasing stress, with a tendency for higher shares of medium income to have more than expected network

### LTS and high income

- Density and high income - areas with low shares of high income have more than equal density of low stress - and network in general, but less pronounced.

- Length and high income: inequality, higher shares of high income have more than expected infra?? Same for all levels

### 50th percentile

Not that interesting patterns? For density, lower income have above eq. density, same for all network levels - opposite for length

### 80th percentile

#### Density

- Lower values and higher values above expected for LTS 1 - middle equal or below.
- For other lower values higher than expected

#### Length

- LTS 1: Inequality, lower values less then equal - but not drastic?
- LTS 2: Same - closer to equality?
- For rest - Crosses the line of equality - below for lower income, above for higher, then meets the line of equality

### Cars

#### With car

- For density - above the line of equality, areas with low car ownership above expected?
- For length - below. Inequality bigger/more extreme for higher lts and total network?

#### 1 car

- Same as with car - but less extreme?

#### 2+ cars

- Also similar.
- Look at CCI values to compare to with/1 car.

#### No car

- Reversed patterns.
- Slightly different shapes of the length curves - something about middle or high rates of no car ownership?
