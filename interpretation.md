# Interpretation of results

## Socio variables and share of bikeability clusters

- Negative relationship between share of high bikeability and car ownership

- Positive relationship between share of high income and low bikeability

- Interesting pattern for share of hex cluster 5 (highest bikeability)? Because of strong spatial clustering of this one?

- Some correlation of share of cluster 3 and high income

- Otherwise no clear patterns?
