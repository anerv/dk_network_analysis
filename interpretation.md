# Interpretation of results

## DENSITY

* Based on stack bar charts, most municipalities have comparable ratios of different levels of LTS? (of course with some variations - value ranges of LTS 1 13.6 - 43.6%, median and average around 30%, LTS 2 25-65%, mean and median around 40%.)

At the local and grid level, obviously much larger variations.

At the global, adm and socio level, the median levels ordered after share:

* 2
* 1
* 3
* 4

(ofc total car highest)

At grid level:

* Same, but *much* closer values.
* Important to remember that LTS 3 and 4 etc. are for network used by cyclists! Not for roads with separate bike tracks.

Highly uneven distribution of both network length AND density.

Density distributions are different at various aggregation levels - but at socio and hex grid LTS 1+2 and LTS 3+4 follow roughly same distribution.

### Spatial distributions

* At socio level - *share* of LTS 1 is not an urban phenomenon - but absolute quantity is.
* Same for LTS 2
* Absolute values for LTS 3 a bit 'random' - but low in CPH. *Share* of LTS 3 low in larger cities.
* LTS 4 - not urban - neither based on share or absolute values.

Results for spatial autocorrelation:

#### HEX GRID

* Significant clustering of network density - obviously
* Significant clustering of LTS 1 density and LTS relative length - but not the same places!
* Sig clustering of LTS 2 dens and rel. length - overlapping but not identical clusters.
* Sig clustering of LTS 3 dens - but small scattered clusters. Slightly bigger clusters for LTS 3 share.
* LTS 4 dens - sig but sparse clustering - this might change with new results!! LTS 4 share - sig clustering, especially of low LTS 4 share.
* Car dens/car share - sig. clustering - but reversed (i.e. high dens in cities, but low share).

#### Socio

* Same for LTS 1 - mostly not the same places with a high dens and high share, but both sig.
* LTS 2 - same
* LTS 3 - sig., overlapping but not identical clusters
* LTS 4 - stronger clustering tendency than hex? Overlapping but not identical clusters for dens and share
