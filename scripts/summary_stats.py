#

# MAKE STYLIZED DATAFRAME
# EXPORT TO CSV

# Total length of network
# Total length of each LTS level

# MIN, MAX, MEAN, AND MEDIAN OF EACH LTS FOR EACH AGGREGATION LEVEL

# Make municipal dataframe with LTS length in abs value and pct of total network

# What are the patterns - always the same order of the different levels in all aggregations?
# (e.g. less 1 than 2 than 3 than 4) (of course not using stepwise length)

# do places tend to have more car than bike?


# What are the interesting questions??
# - How does the LTS distribution change with aggregation level?
# - how does the value ranges differ between the different aggregation levels and different levels of LTS?
