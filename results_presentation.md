## DENSITY

- Presented globally and at grid cell level
    - Tables with global breakdowns
    - Plot of distributions of LTS? Simple bar chart
    - density distributions KDE at hex level
    - Maps hex levels - figure out whether to focus on %, classified, etc

## FRAGMENTATION

- Global Zipf plot
- Exame corr between density and fragmentation at municipal level - because???
- Corr plots of densities and comp count (colored clusters)

## REACH

- KDE - also for diff? Make sure I understand what it means!!
- Reach maps - total, diff - areas with more bike reach than car?
	- double check calculations
- Make plot that illustrates the jump in reach when including 1->2 etc.
- Consider experiementing with reach at different levels - compare 5 to 10 to 15

## ANALYSIS

- Corr between different vars - density, frag, reach at socio -level

- Clustering?? At socio-level
